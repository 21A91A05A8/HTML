	<h1>About Page</h1>
	<p>Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[17] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[18] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company.</p>
